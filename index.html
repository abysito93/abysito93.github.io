                <p id="main">I'm a student of the university of Arecibo currently majoring in Computer Programming, I've been developing since 2011. I started
                    out using C++, then continued using Java and other languages. Now I am practicing with HTML and CSS for developing website.
                    Been using the MEAN Stack for developing single page application since 2014, I find it very useful and simple. Been meaning to
                    learn about Angular 2 since it's part of the MEAN and that's pretty much it.
